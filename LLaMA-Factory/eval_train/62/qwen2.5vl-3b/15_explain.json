However, the text itself does not express explicit praise or criticism toward the Blackhawks; it merely describes a neutral game situation.",
        "Improvement": "The model should focus on the absence of explicit sentiment cues in the text. Descriptions of gameplay (e.g., \"battles in the crease,\" \"makes a save\") are factual and do not inherently convey positivity or negativity. The model should prioritize literal interpretation unless clear emotional language (e.g., \"amazing play by the Blackhawks\" or \"poor effort by the Blackhawks\") is present. Training on more neutral sports commentary examples could help reinforce this distinction."

It should recognize that a factual announcement without evaluative language (e.g., \"released in Russia today\") is inherently neutral.
